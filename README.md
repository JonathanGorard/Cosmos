# Enhanced Quick Start Guide for macOS Users

This guide streamlines the setup process for running Euler simulations on macOS, incorporating best practices for installation and compatibility verification.

## Step 1: Environment Setup

Create a dedicated environment `eulerSimEnv` for dependency management.

1. **Install Homebrew**:
   - Ensure Homebrew is installed for managing packages.
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Python 3**:
   - Use Homebrew to install the latest Python version.
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```

3. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Create `eulerSimEnv` and activate it.
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv eulerSimEnv
   source eulerSimEnv/bin/activate
   ```

## Step 2: Compiler and Libraries

Install a C++ compiler and necessary libraries.

- **Xcode and Command Line Tools**:
  - Install from the App Store and run:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

- **Eigen and HDF5**:
  - Install using Homebrew.
  ```bash
  brew install hdf5
  ```

## Step 3: Validate Installation

Ensure tools and libraries are correctly installed.

- **Check Compiler**:
  ```bash
  g++ --version
  ```

- **Verify Python and Virtual Environment**:
  ```bash
  python --version
  which python
  ```

- **Test Library Installation**:
  - For HDF5:
    ```bash
    brew list | grep hdf5
    ```

## Running the Simulation

After setup, compile and run a Euler simulation example.

1. **Compile the Simulation**:
   - Navigate to the simulation directory.
   - Compile using `g++` (replace `YourSimulationFile.cpp` with your file):
   ```bash
   g++ -o EulerSimulation YourSimulationFile.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lhdf5
   ```

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   ```bash
   ./EulerSimulation
   ```

3. **Deactivate Environment** (when done):
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## Automation Script

For convenience, you can automate the setup and execution process using a script. Save the following as `setup_and_run.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Homebrew, Python, and create a virtual environment
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install python
python3 -m venv eulerSimEnv
source eulerSimEnv/bin/activate

# Install necessary tools and libraries
xcode-select --install
brew install hdf5

# Compile and run the simulation
g++ -o EulerSimulation main.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lhdf5
./EulerSimulation

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

Make the script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x setup_and_run.sh
./setup_and_run.sh
```

This script streamlines the entire process, from environment setup to running the simulation.


Save the script in the root directory of your project where your simulation source files are located. This ensures that the script has direct access to the files it needs to compile and run. Here's how you can do this:

1. Open Terminal on your macOS.
2. Navigate to your project's root directory using the `cd` command. Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Use the following command to create the script file directly in the terminal. It will open an editor in the terminal:
   ```bash
   nano setup_and_run.sh
   ```
4. Copy the script content provided in the previous response into the editor.
5. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`, and exit the editor with `Ctrl + X`.

To make the script executable and run it, use the following commands in the terminal while you are still in your project's root directory:

```bash
chmod +x setup_and_run.sh
./setup_and_run.sh
```

This process places the script in the correct directory and ensures it has the necessary permissions to execute.
